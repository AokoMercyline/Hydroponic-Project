    <h1>GREEN LIVING</h1>


    Green living is a website company which deals with planting of flowers using the new modern way of farming<br>
    commonly known as Hydroponic Farming.
    You are in aperfect place if you were looking for a perfect way of decorating your balcony and homestade<br>
    as well using this kind of agriculture.

    <h2> About us</h2>

    We all love seeing beautiful things, that is what nature provides but this beautiful nature
    depends on the soil. Technology has ventured into the world in many different ways, and
    our website will adapt to this new technology. Our website works out different nature
    without involving soil but with pumice stones which are more nutritious for plant
    growth. The website will decorate homes using flowers which are planted in toughs and
    watered automatically with a counter current water flow, and that is; hydroponic holticulture.



    <h2>Benefits of using of Hydroponic holticulture in decorating the house</h2>


    There are so many benefits of using holticultural hydroponic in our different home stead, below are just but a few
    reasons as to why you should embrace this method.


    <div class="one">
        <h2> 1. No soil is needed</h2>

        <p> <strong>Farmers can have total control over a hydroponic system.</strong>
            <br> They are able to manage pH and nutrients to make sure plants are getting the exact nutrients they need.
            </br>
            <br> The systems are closed and recycle the water that is not used by plants. The ability to grow indoors
            allows farmers to control temperatures and lighting schedules to improve plant production. </br>
            Systems can be designed to make use of vertical space and increase planting density. Hydroponics also allow
            us to create farms in locations where soil conditions are too poor to support farming, or space is limited
            and a farm otherwise couldnâ€™t exist.</p>

        <p> Planting flowers has environmental benefits. According to Project Green, plants help to remove pollutants
            from the air.</p>
        <p> During the process of photosynthesis, the flower's leaves absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.</p>

    <h2>3. Enhances the mood</h2>

    According to a study completed by Virginia Lohr and Caroline Pearson-Mims at Washington State University,<br>
    plants such as trees or flowers have a positive impact on people and increase a person's overall feeling of well
    being.<br>
    The study's participants displayed increased friendliness and happiness while viewing urban scenery that included
    trees.<br>
    This study shows that plants impact human emotion and enhance positive feelings.

    <h2>5. Good exercise</h2>

    Gardeners can reap physical benefits from planting flowers.<br>
    According to the American Association of Retired Persons, gardening is an effective workout that uses many different
    muscle groups while increasing flexibility.<br>
    Digging and planting burns calories and uses muscles while reaching and bending stretches the body to increase
    elasticity in those muscles.<br>
    The exercise also burns calories at a rate ranging from 57 to 135 calories for every 15 minutes spent performing the
    activity.<br>
    The number of calories burned varies in accordance with the weight of the gardener.


    <h2> Hydroponic structures and their functions</h2>

    Hydroponic system are customised and modifird according to the recycling and reuse of nutrients solution and support
    media.<br>
    Commonly used systms are wick, drip, eb flow,deep water culture and nutrient film technique.<br>

    <div><em> This is simplest hydroponic system requiring no electricity pump amd aerators, commonly known as wick
            system.
        </em></div>
    <h2>Slanting style</h2>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li> When the water runs to one trough and full it will
                automatically flow through the other troughs.</li>
            <li>After the water as go into all the troughs,
                the water goes into a lower tank which pump the water again to the initial tank. <em>This
                    process will be automatically, that is why it is called counter current water flow because
                    it is a two way channel.</em></li>
            <li>The troughs are arranged in a slanting position or horizontally to
                allow the water to flow from one trough to the other trough and so one and so forth.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Therefore, the price of decoration to be used will depended on the slating position of
            the flower to be used in the homes. The flower will also help in the circulation of air
            which is the most important thing in both human and plant life. That free air that the
            flower will bring is a key factor because it will reduce the human intake of carbon
            dioxide, which is a toxic gases to the human race.</p>

        <p>The key factor that our website plans
            to achieve in the decoration of homes is to increase the life by reducing the intake of
            carbon dioxide which affects the breathing system, that is the key element to human
            being.</p>

        <p><em>The tank could also be connected with a switch so that the it can be powered on
                that could start the counter current flow of water for the growth of the flower.</em> This
            process could also be manual by opening the tank tap for water to flow out of the tank.
            The process is sufficient in both manual and electrical method because after all the
            water has gone through the troughs, it will automatically run back to the initial tank. This
            will prevent lose of water therefore saves water as they tanks will only be filled once a
            month or at least a week.</p>

        <p>The water is being re-used back again as the troughs has
            holes that allows water to flow to other troughs and back to the initial tank through the
            second tank which pumps the water to that tank. <strong>Water conservation is highly considered.</strong>
